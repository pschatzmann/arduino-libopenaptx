# arduino-libopenaptx

This is Open Source implementation of Audio Processing Technology codec (aptX)
originally derived from ffmpeg 4.0 project and licensed under GPLv3+. 

I converted https://github.com/pali/libopenaptx to an Arduino Library

## Licence

Please read the [license information of the orignal project](README.orig)

## Installation

For Arduino, you can download the library as zip and call include Library -> zip library. Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder e.g. with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone pschatzmann/arduino-liblc3.git
```
This has the advantage that you can easily get the latest code updates by just executing the command ```git pull```
